# Search Issues

### Overview
The Search Issues functionality in the AskTheCode plugin empowers users to query Github repository issues using natural language. This feature enhances the user's ability to find relevant issues quickly and efficiently.

### Why It's Useful
- **Natural Language Queries**: Enables users to search for issues using conversational language, making the process intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Focused Results**: Retrieves issues that are closely related to the user's query, saving time in sifting through unrelated issues.
- **Issue Details**: Delve deeper into the issue thread using the [Github Issues](/features/github-issues) feature.

In this example, the user queries for all issues related to the `ConversationChain` in the [Langchain repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain). After retrieving the issues search results, we delve deeper into the specific issue we are interested in.
