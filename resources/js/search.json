This limit is due to the current restrictions of ChatGPT for the maximum plugin response size.","Large Files: Issues can occur with very large files due to the limits of the ChatGPT context size. It's recommended to be cautious when analyzing large files.","Repository Structure Limit: Currently, the plugin can retrieve the structure of repositories that have less than 100,000 files with a maximum size of 7 MB for their structure. This limitation is derived from the GitHub tree endpoint."]},{"l":"Sample"},{"l":"Basic sample","p":["The sample and guidelines can be found here"]},{"l":"Retrieving Files by Pages","p":["Sometimes you might prompt ChatGPT for something that will require it to query multiple files from the repository, and the total size of these files can be quite large. If the plugin were to simply return all contents to ChatGPT, it would significantly overflow the context of the GPT-4 model used under the hood, and resulted in a poor response quality. To prevent this, the plugin detects when the total size of the requested files is significant and pages them.","Let's assume that we want to query all functions defined in the Langchain Utils directory.","Sample conversation: https://chat.openai.com/share/f349d959-d957-47f7-a7f7-0febe9197602","The total size of all files within this directory is large, which would result in ChatGPT compressing file contents, significantly impacting the response quality.
